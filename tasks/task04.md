Update the dashboard page to include a table with a list of stock tickers and their corresponding latest price.

The table should have the columns below:
1. Symbol
2. Last Price
3. Total Return
4. Value/Cost

Symbol: Stock Ticker
Last Price: The most recent trading price for the stock.
Total Return: Your personal gain or loss on this holding, shown in both percentage (%) and dollar ($) terms
Value/Cost: The current market value of your holding versus the total amount you paid for it.

Mock up the frontend first.
